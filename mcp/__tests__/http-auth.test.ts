/*
 * GENERATED_MAINTAINER_REFERENCE:BEGIN
 *
 * AUTO-GENERATED MAINTAINER REFERENCE — DO NOT EDIT THIS BLOCK BY HAND.
 * It is derived from the current TypeScript AST and repository-area contracts.
 * Regenerate after structural edits so imports, exports, landmarks, and checks stay current.
 *
 * **Module:** mcp/__tests__/http-auth.test.ts
 * **Area:** MCP test
 * **Responsibility:**
 * Verifies MCP HTTP transport bearer-token matching without starting a network listener.
 *
 * ## Architectural boundary
 * - Protects MCP schema, policy, API-client, formatting, lifecycle, or transport behavior using
 *   Node's test runner.
 * - Tests should exercise public contracts with realistic SDK and HTTP boundaries while keeping
 *   external state local.
 * - Fixtures must not contain usable credentials or depend on the operator's real dashboard
 *   configuration.
 *
 * ## Local dependency edges
 * - `../src/transports/http-server.js` — repository-local contract consumed by this module; review
 *   its exports before changing assumptions here.
 *
 * ## Package dependency edges
 * - `node:assert/strict` — external package boundary; keep usage within the installed version and
 *   the repository's existing adapter patterns.
 * - `node:test` — external package boundary; keep usage within the installed version and the
 *   repository's existing adapter patterns.
 *
 * ## Named test contracts
 * - `accepts bearer and x-mcp-token credentials` — executable behavior named by this suite;
 *   preserve the observable contract or update the test with rationale.
 * - `is disabled when no token is configured` — executable behavior named by this suite; preserve
 *   the observable contract or update the test with rationale.
 * - `MCP HTTP authentication` — executable behavior named by this suite; preserve the observable
 *   contract or update the test with rationale.
 * - `rejects missing or invalid credentials` — executable behavior named by this suite; preserve
 *   the observable contract or update the test with rationale.
 *
 * ## Area invariants
 * - Name the exact protocol or policy contract in each test so a failure identifies the broken
 *   boundary.
 * - Use ephemeral ports, temporary directories, and isolated environment values for concurrent-safe
 *   execution.
 * - Restore process globals, environment variables, clocks, fetch stubs, and listeners after every
 *   case.
 * - Assert structured results and error shapes rather than only checking that a call throws.
 * - Cover redaction and permission denial for every secret-bearing or state-changing path.
 * - Avoid snapshotting unstable SDK internals when a focused schema or result assertion is clearer.
 * - Test cleanup and idempotence because abandoned transports and timers can keep the process
 *   alive.
 * - Keep test doubles behaviorally faithful to the API client methods used by the subject.
 * - Exercise malformed and boundary inputs at schema and direct-function layers where each owns
 *   distinct validation.
 * - Prove regression tests fail against the broken behavior before accepting a fix.
 *
 * ## Change-review checklist
 * - Read the file header and this generated index before changing code; both describe the intended
 *   ownership boundary.
 * - Trace every local import listed here to distinguish data contracts from presentation helpers
 *   and avoid circular dependencies.
 * - Search every exported symbol before changing its signature; callers may live in tests, route
 *   components, desktop code, or MCP wiring.
 * - Keep observable behavior stable unless the task explicitly requests a behavior change and
 *   includes regression coverage.
 * - Prefer the repository's existing helpers and types over parallel abstractions that encode the
 *   same contract twice.
 * - Keep failure behavior explicit: recoverable local failures should degrade visibly without
 *   hiding actionable diagnostics.
 * - Preserve deterministic ordering for lists, maps, serialized values, snapshots, and generated
 *   output where this module participates.
 * - Treat identifiers, API paths, event names, translation keys, and persisted field names as
 *   compatibility surfaces.
 * - Update the truthful file overview when the module's responsibility changes; never let the
 *   header become historical fiction.
 * - Run the narrowest relevant test first, then the area gate, then the full repository
 *   verification before merging.
 *
 * ## Focused validation
 * - Run `npm run test:mcp` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run mcp:typecheck` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run mcp:build` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 *
 * ## Reference maintenance
 * - Regenerate all tracked references with `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --write` .
 * - Check this module without writing via
 *   `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --check mcp/__tests__/http-auth.test.ts` .
 * - Prove existing-file edits are comments/trivia only with
 *   `node scripts/verify-typescript-comment-only.ts origin/master` .
 * - Review the regenerated diff: generated structure is evidence, not a substitute for
 *   understanding runtime behavior.

/* =============================================================================
 * TEST_CONTRACT_GUIDE — executable-specification map (documentation only)
 * =============================================================================
 * Path: `mcp/__tests__/http-auth.test.ts`
 *
 * Scope
 * Verifies MCP HTTP transport bearer-token matching without starting a network listener.
 *
 * Subjects and collaborators
 * - `../src/transports/http-server.js` — local module imported by this suite.
 *
 * Harness and isolation
 * - Node's built-in test runner supplies suite lifecycle and isolation; `node:assert/strict` keeps
 *   equality and failure semantics explicit. Every case must be order-independent.
 *
 * Suite groups
 * - `MCP HTTP authentication`
 *
 * Protected behavior
 * - is disabled when no token is configured
 * - accepts bearer and x-mcp-token credentials
 * - rejects missing or invalid credentials
 *
 * Maintenance rules
 * - Keep assertions at observable boundaries: rendered output, public return values, emitted events, or
 *   wire payloads.
 * - When behavior changes intentionally, update the matching case title and this map in the same
 *   review.
 * - Prefer one reason for failure per case; shared setup may remove noise but must not hide the state
 *   under test.
 * - Reset spies, fake timers, storage, and singleton subscriptions so reruns and shuffled execution
 *   remain stable.
 * - Add regression coverage beside the narrowest existing group that expresses the affected user or API
 *   contract.
 * - Keep MCP assertions aligned with tool schemas and JSON-RPC error semantics; transport failures must
 *   stay diagnosable.
 *
 * Verification
 * - Run `npm run test:mcp`, `npm run mcp:typecheck`, and `npm run mcp:build` after changing this area.
 * - The repository-wide `npm run verify` gate also checks headers, formatting, server tests, and client
 *   tests.
