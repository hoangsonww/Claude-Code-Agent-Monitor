/*
 * GENERATED_MAINTAINER_REFERENCE:BEGIN
 *
 * AUTO-GENERATED MAINTAINER REFERENCE — DO NOT EDIT THIS BLOCK BY HAND.
 * It is derived from the current TypeScript AST and repository-area contracts.
 * Regenerate after structural edits so imports, exports, landmarks, and checks stay current.
 *
 * **Module:** mcp/src/tools/domains/push-tools.ts
 * **Area:** MCP tool
 * **Responsibility:**
 * MCP tools for the browser push-notification API, including VAPID discovery, subscription
 * management, and test notification delivery.
 *
 * ## Architectural boundary
 * - Exposes one dashboard capability through a schema-validated MCP tool while delegating data
 *   access to the API client.
 * - Tool descriptions and schemas are part of the model-facing API and must remain precise enough
 *   for safe selection.
 * - Mutation and destructive permissions are enforced centrally and cannot be bypassed by a domain
 *   handler.
 *
 * ## Local dependency edges
 * - `../../core/tool-registry.js` — repository-local contract consumed by this module; review its
 *   exports before changing assumptions here.
 * - `../../policy/tool-guards.js` — repository-local contract consumed by this module; review its
 *   exports before changing assumptions here.
 * - `../../types/tool-context.js` — repository-local contract consumed by this module; review its
 *   exports before changing assumptions here.
 *
 * ## Package dependency edges
 * - `zod` — external package boundary; keep usage within the installed version and the repository's
 *   existing adapter patterns.
 *
 * ## Public surface
 * - `registerPushTools` (function) — exported contract; search downstream imports and tests before
 *   changing its name, shape, or timing.
 *
 * ## Top-level implementation landmarks
 * - `PushSubscriptionSchema` (variable) — top-level declaration that helps orient code review and
 *   focused test selection.
 * - `registerPushTools` (function) — top-level declaration that helps orient code review and
 *   focused test selection.
 *
 * ## Literal API paths
 * - `/api/push/send` — route literal present in this source; keep request/response expectations
 *   aligned with the server and API docs.
 * - `/api/push/subscribe` — route literal present in this source; keep request/response
 *   expectations aligned with the server and API docs.
 * - `/api/push/vapid-public-key` — route literal present in this source; keep request/response
 *   expectations aligned with the server and API docs.
 *
 * ## Area invariants
 * - Validate every argument with the declared schema before constructing requests or selecting
 *   resource identifiers.
 * - Keep read, mutation, and destructive operations correctly classified for policy guards.
 * - Return structured tool results through shared helpers so errors and JSON payloads remain
 *   transport-neutral.
 * - Do not leak dashboard tokens, webhook secrets, SSH material, raw environment values, or
 *   unredacted configuration.
 * - Preserve pagination and explicit limits for potentially large session, event, transcript, or
 *   metrics responses.
 * - Use exact API route and field names from the typed client rather than duplicating ad hoc HTTP
 *   calls.
 * - Keep tool names stable; hosts and prompts may persist them outside this repository.
 * - Explain confirmation requirements in both schema descriptions and policy errors for destructive
 *   actions.
 * - Keep handlers independent of stdio, HTTP, and REPL transport details.
 * - Test successful, validation, permission-denied, API-error, and redaction paths for each
 *   risk-bearing tool.
 *
 * ## Change-review checklist
 * - Read the file header and this generated index before changing code; both describe the intended
 *   ownership boundary.
 * - Trace every local import listed here to distinguish data contracts from presentation helpers
 *   and avoid circular dependencies.
 * - Search every exported symbol before changing its signature; callers may live in tests, route
 *   components, desktop code, or MCP wiring.
 * - Keep observable behavior stable unless the task explicitly requests a behavior change and
 *   includes regression coverage.
 * - Prefer the repository's existing helpers and types over parallel abstractions that encode the
 *   same contract twice.
 * - Keep failure behavior explicit: recoverable local failures should degrade visibly without
 *   hiding actionable diagnostics.
 * - Preserve deterministic ordering for lists, maps, serialized values, snapshots, and generated
 *   output where this module participates.
 * - Treat identifiers, API paths, event names, translation keys, and persisted field names as
 *   compatibility surfaces.
 * - Update the truthful file overview when the module's responsibility changes; never let the
 *   header become historical fiction.
 * - Run the narrowest relevant test first, then the area gate, then the full repository
 *   verification before merging.
 *
 * ## Focused validation
 * - Run `npm run mcp:typecheck` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run mcp:build` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run test:mcp` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 *
 * ## Reference maintenance
 * - Regenerate all tracked references with `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --write` .
 * - Check this module without writing via
 *   `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --check mcp/src/tools/domains/push-tools.ts` .
 * - Prove existing-file edits are comments/trivia only with
 *   `node scripts/verify-typescript-comment-only.ts origin/master` .
 * - Review the regenerated diff: generated structure is evidence, not a substitute for
 *   understanding runtime behavior.

/* =============================================================================
 * MODULE_GUIDE — extended in-file reference (comments only; safe to read, never executed)
 * =============================================================================
 * **Path:** `mcp/src/tools/domains/push-tools.ts`
 * **Purpose:** Part of the local MCP server (`npm run mcp:start`) that exposes dashboard operations as MCP tools for Claude Code and other hosts.
 *
 * ## Design constraints
 * - Local-first: no telemetry leaves the machine unless the user configures webhooks.
 * - Fail-safe hooks path on the server must never block Claude Code; UI mirrors that
 *   philosophy by degrading gracefully (empty states, stale badges, reconnect loops).
 * - Destructive flows stay behind explicit confirmation modals and server-side gates.
 * - Internationalization: user-visible strings belong in i18n JSON, not literals here.
 *
 * ## Remote data & SSH
 * Remote Data Sources let operators aggregate multiple machines. SSH entries describe
 * how to reach a peer dashboard; the global data scope (`dataScope.ts`) narrows every
 * scoped GET via `?sources=`. Health checks and import history surface in Settings.
 *
 * ## Observability
 * Prometheus scrapes `GET /api/metrics` (see `monitoring/`). Grafana ships four
 * provisioned boards (overview, sessions, tools, alerts). Native npm scripts and
 * Docker Compose profiles are documented in `monitoring/README.md`.
 *
 * ## Internal dependencies
 * - `../../core/tool-registry.js`
 * - `../../policy/tool-guards.js`
 * - `../../types/tool-context.js`
 *
 * ## Public surface
 * - `registerPushTools` — exported API; see TSDoc on the symbol for behavior.
 *
 * ## Testing pointers
 * - Prefer colocated `__tests__` with Vitest + Testing Library for UI.
 * - Server contract changes require `npm run test:server` and OpenAPI sync.
 * - MCP edits: `npm run mcp:typecheck` and `npm run mcp:build`.
 *
 * ## Related docs
 * - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — hooks → API → SQLite → WebSocket → UI pipeline.
 * - `docs/API.md` — REST reference.
 * - `.claude/skills/file-headers/` — mandatory `@author` header policy.
