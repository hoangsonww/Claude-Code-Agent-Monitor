# Installation

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ | Required for server and client |
| npm | 9+ | Comes with Node.js |
| Claude Code | 2.x+ | Required for hook integration |
| Python | 3.6+ | Optional — statusline utility only |
| Git | Any | For cloning the repository |

---

## Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor.git
cd Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor
```

---

## Step 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
npm run setup
```

This installs all server and client dependencies in a single command. It is equivalent to:

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install
```

---

## Step 3 — Start the dashboard

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts two processes concurrently:

| Process | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Express server | http://localhost:4820 | API, WebSocket, SQLite |
| Vite dev server | http://localhost:5173 | React frontend with HMR |

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

> On first startup the server automatically writes the Claude Code hook configuration to `~/.claude/settings.json`. No manual hook installation step is needed.

---

## Step 4 — Start a Claude Code session

Start a new Claude Code session from any directory **after** the dashboard server is running. The hooks will fire automatically and your sessions, agents, and events will appear in real-time.

```bash
# In a separate terminal, from any project directory:
claude
```

---

## Verification

After starting a Claude Code session, you should see:

- **Sessions page** — your session listed with status `Active`
- **Agent Board** — a `Main Agent` card in the `Connected` column
- **Activity Feed** — events streaming in as Claude Code uses tools
- **Dashboard** — stats updating in real-time
- **Settings page** — model pricing rules, hook configuration status, data export and cleanup tools

If nothing appears after 30 seconds, see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md#troubleshooting).

---

## Production mode

To run as a single process serving the built client:

```bash
npm run build   # Build the React client
npm start       # Start Express serving client/dist on port 4820
```

Open **http://localhost:4820** in your browser.
