/*
 * GENERATED_MAINTAINER_REFERENCE:BEGIN
 *
 * AUTO-GENERATED MAINTAINER REFERENCE — DO NOT EDIT THIS BLOCK BY HAND.
 * It is derived from the current TypeScript AST and repository-area contracts.
 * Regenerate after structural edits so imports, exports, landmarks, and checks stay current.
 *
 * **Module:** desktop/src/preload.ts
 * **Area:** desktop shell
 * **Responsibility:**
 * Preload script. The dashboard runs as standard web content loaded from `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
 * . It does not need privileged APIs to function; keeping this preload empty is intentional and
 * keeps the attack surface minimal. Renderer-side desktop helpers (e.g. native notification
 * routing) can be added here later via `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` if the dashboard ever
 * wants to call them.
 *
 * ## Architectural boundary
 * - Owns Electron main-process lifecycle, local server hosting, native integration, and the narrow
 *   preload boundary.
 * - Renderer code remains web-compatible; privileged filesystem, process, tray, menu, and window
 *   operations stay here.
 * - Startup and shutdown coordinate one dashboard server instance without corrupting discovery or
 *   user data.
 *
 * ## Area invariants
 * - Keep context isolation enabled and expose only the minimum typed preload surface required by
 *   the renderer.
 * - Do not enable arbitrary Node integration or pass unchecked renderer input into
 *   filesystem/process operations.
 * - Make window, tray, server, and app shutdown idempotent across quit, close, signal, and update
 *   paths.
 * - Resolve packaged and development resource paths explicitly for macOS, Windows, and Linux
 *   layouts.
 * - Use atomic writes for discovery and state files that another process may read during startup.
 * - Remove stale discovery metadata only when it belongs to the process being stopped.
 * - Keep single-instance and deep-link handling bounded to the intended application origin.
 * - Preserve platform-specific menu and login-item semantics without assuming one operating system.
 * - Avoid blocking the main process with synchronous work on hot lifecycle paths.
 * - Test pure path/lifecycle decisions and run the desktop-specific suite for process integration
 *   changes.
 *
 * ## Change-review checklist
 * - Read the file header and this generated index before changing code; both describe the intended
 *   ownership boundary.
 * - Trace every local import listed here to distinguish data contracts from presentation helpers
 *   and avoid circular dependencies.
 * - Search every exported symbol before changing its signature; callers may live in tests, route
 *   components, desktop code, or MCP wiring.
 * - Keep observable behavior stable unless the task explicitly requests a behavior change and
 *   includes regression coverage.
 * - Prefer the repository's existing helpers and types over parallel abstractions that encode the
 *   same contract twice.
 * - Keep failure behavior explicit: recoverable local failures should degrade visibly without
 *   hiding actionable diagnostics.
 * - Preserve deterministic ordering for lists, maps, serialized values, snapshots, and generated
 *   output where this module participates.
 * - Treat identifiers, API paths, event names, translation keys, and persisted field names as
 *   compatibility surfaces.
 * - Update the truthful file overview when the module's responsibility changes; never let the
 *   header become historical fiction.
 * - Run the narrowest relevant test first, then the area gate, then the full repository
 *   verification before merging.
 *
 * ## Focused validation
 * - Run `npm run desktop:test` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run desktop:build` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 * - Run `npm run verify` and resolve failures before widening the verification scope.
 *
 * ## Reference maintenance
 * - Regenerate all tracked references with `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --write` .
 * - Check this module without writing via
 *   `node scripts/maintain-typescript-docs.ts --check desktop/src/preload.ts` .
 * - Prove existing-file edits are comments/trivia only with
 *   `node scripts/verify-typescript-comment-only.ts origin/master` .
 * - Review the regenerated diff: generated structure is evidence, not a substitute for
 *   understanding runtime behavior.

/* =============================================================================
 * MODULE_GUIDE — extended in-file reference (comments only; safe to read, never executed)
 * =============================================================================
 * **Path:** `/Users/davidnguyen/WebstormProjects/Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor/desktop/src/preload.ts`
 * **Purpose:** Dashboard module consumed by the React client, MCP tools, or desktop shell depending on deployment mode.
 *
 * ## Design constraints
 * - Local-first: no telemetry leaves the machine unless the user configures webhooks.
 * - Fail-safe hooks path on the server must never block Claude Code; UI mirrors that
 *   philosophy by degrading gracefully (empty states, stale badges, reconnect loops).
 * - Destructive flows stay behind explicit confirmation modals and server-side gates.
 * - Internationalization: user-visible strings belong in i18n JSON, not literals here.
 *
 * ## Remote data & SSH
 * Remote Data Sources let operators aggregate multiple machines. SSH entries describe
 * how to reach a peer dashboard; the global data scope (`dataScope.ts`) narrows every
 * scoped GET via `?sources=`. Health checks and import history surface in Settings.
 *
 * ## Observability
 * Prometheus scrapes `GET /api/metrics` (see `monitoring/`). Grafana ships four
 * provisioned boards (overview, sessions, tools, alerts). Native npm scripts and
 * Docker Compose profiles are documented in `monitoring/README.md`.
 *
 * ## Testing pointers
 * - Prefer colocated `__tests__` with Vitest + Testing Library for UI.
 * - Server contract changes require `npm run test:server` and OpenAPI sync.
 * - MCP edits: `npm run mcp:typecheck` and `npm run mcp:build`.
 *
 * ## Related docs
 * - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — hooks → API → SQLite → WebSocket → UI pipeline.
 * - `docs/API.md` — REST reference.
 * - `.claude/skills/file-headers/` — mandatory `@author` header policy.
